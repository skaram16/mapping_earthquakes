# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview:
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Resouces:
- Data Source: [Earthquakes GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), [Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson), [Tectonic Plate GeoJSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, Leaflet 1.7.1, D3.js 6.2.0

## Results:
### Create a Mapbox account, setup *config.js* and open *index.html*
To interact with the maps API the user has to visit [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/), and create a Mapbox account and retrieve the free access token.
